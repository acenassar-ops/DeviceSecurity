```markdown
# DeviceSecurity

**DeviceSecurity** is a lightweight, modular Swift Package that performs runtime security checks on iOS devices to detect potential threats such as jailbreaking, simulators, attached debuggers, and reverse engineering tools. It is designed for easy integration and high customizability with no third-party dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Jailbreak Detection** (file presence, symbolic links, write attempts)
- ✅ **Simulator Detection**
- ✅ **Debugger Detection**
- ✅ **Unified API**: `DeviceSecurity.isSecure`
- ✅ **No third-party dependencies**
- ✅ **Modular architecture**
- ✅ **SPM-compatible (local or remote)**
- ✅ **Public API documentation**
- ✅ **Basic unit tests included**

---

## 📦 Integration

### ✅ Add via Swift Package Manager (Remote)

Add the package to your project via:

```

[https://github.com/acenassar-ops/DeviceSecurity](https://github.com/acenassar-ops/DeviceSecurity)

````

Then import it in your code:

```swift
import DeviceSecurity
````

---

### ✅ Add via Local SPM

1. Clone the repo or copy the package to your project directory.
2. In Xcode: **File > Add Packages...**
3. Select “Add Local...” and point to the `DeviceSecurity` directory.

---

## 🛡 Usage

```swift
import DeviceSecurity

if DeviceSecurity.isSecure {
    // Safe to proceed
} else {
    // Log, restrict access, or trigger alerts
}
```

---

## 📂 Structure

```
DeviceSecurity/
├── Package.swift
└── Sources/
    └── DeviceSecurity/
        ├── DeviceSecurity.swift         // Unified wrapper API
        ├── RootChecker.swift            // Jailbreak detection
        ├── SimulatorChecker.swift       // Simulator detection
        └── DebuggerChecker.swift        // Debugger detection
```

Each checker is modular and testable.

---

## 🧪 Unit Tests

Basic unit tests are provided (where feasible) under:

```
Tests/DeviceSecurityTests/
```

Run tests with:

```bash
swift test
```

---

## 📖 API Reference

### `DeviceSecurity.isSecure: Bool`

Returns `false` if any of the following are detected:

* Jailbreak indicators (`RootChecker`)
* Running on Simulator (`SimulatorChecker`)
* Debugger attached (`DebuggerChecker`)

---

### Modular Checkers

You may also use individual checkers directly if needed:

```swift
let isJailbroken = RootChecker.isJailbroken
let isSimulator = SimulatorChecker.isSimulator
let isDebuggerAttached = DebuggerChecker.isDebuggerAttached
```

Each checker is a `struct` with a public static `Bool` property.

---

## ✅ Requirements

* iOS 11+
* Swift 5.6+
* No third-party libraries

---

## 📄 License

MIT License. See `LICENSE` file for details.

---

## 🙌 Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo, improve it, and submit pull requests.

---

## 🔒 Disclaimer

This package uses known heuristics and best-effort runtime checks. No jailbreak or reverse engineering detection is 100% reliable. Always combine with server-side validation and other security practices.

Would you like me to generate the `Sources/DeviceSecurity` files (`DeviceSecurity.swift`, `RootChecker.swift`, etc.) next with proper code and comments?
